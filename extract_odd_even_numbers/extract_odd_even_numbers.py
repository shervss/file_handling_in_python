# Purpose: A program that will read a file named numbers.txt containing 20 integers 
#          and create two other text files: even.txt, which will contain all the even 
#          numbers extracted from numbers.txt, and odd.txt, which will contain all the 
#          odd numbers extracted from numbers.txt.
