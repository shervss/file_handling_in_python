#         reading the source text file named integers.txt, which contains 
#         20 integers. The first output file will be named double.txt, 
#         containing the square of all even integers found in integers.txt, 
#         and the second file will be named triple.txt, containing the cube 
#         of all odd numbers found in integers.txt.

# Purpose
